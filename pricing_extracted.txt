Prompts are billed similarly to other GPT models. Image outputs cost approximately $0.01 (low), $0.04 (medium), and $0.17 (high) for square images.
*available via the Responses API
For detailed token usage by image quality and size, see the
docs
.
Responses API
Our newest API combining the simplicity of Chat Completions with the built-in tool use of Assistants.
Price
Responses API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model’s input and output rates.
Chat Completions API
Build text-based conversational experiences.
Price
Chat Completions API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Assistants API
Build assistant-like experiences with our tools.
Price
Assistants API is not priced separately. Tokens are billed at the chosen language model's input and output rates.
Built-in tools
Extend model capabilities with built-in tools in the API Platform.

File Search Tool Call
(Responses API only)
$2.50 / 1k tool calls
Web Search Tool Call
There are two components that contribute to the cost of using the web search tool: (1) Tool calls and (2) Search content tokens.
Tool calls are billed per 1,000 calls, according to the tool version and model type.
Search content tokens are tokens retrieved from the search index and fed to the model alongside your prompt to generate an answer. These are billed at the model’s input token rate, unless otherwise specified.

For gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4.1-mini with the web search non-preview tool, search content tokens are charged as a fixed block of 8,000 input tokens per call.
The billing dashboard will report gpt-4.1 and gpt-4.1-mini search line items as ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o’ and ‘web search tool calls | gpt-4o-mini’
GB refers to binary gigabytes of storage (also known as gibibyte), where 1GB is 2^30 bytes.
AgentKit

FAQ
Which model should I use?
We recommend that developers use our large and mini GPT models for everyday tasks. Our large GPT models generally perform better on a wide range of tasks, while our mini GPT models are fast and inexpensive for simpler tasks.
Our large and mini reasoning models are ideal for complex, multi-step tasks and STEM use cases that require deep thinking about tough problems. You can choose the mini reasoning model if you're looking for a faster, more inexpensive option.
We recommend experimenting with all of these models in the
Playground⁠
⁠
(opens in a new window)
to explore which models provide the best price performance trade-off for your usage.
Do you offer an enterprise package or SLAs?
We offer different tiers of access to our enterprise customers that include SLAs, lower latency, and more. Please
contact our sales team
⁠
to learn more.
Will I be charged for API usage in the Playground?
Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage. You will be billed at the per-token input and output prices mentioned above.
How will I know how many tokens I’ve used each month?
A token is a mathematical representation of natural language. Log in to your account to view your
usage tracking dashboard
⁠
(opens in a new window)
. This dashboard will show you how many tokens you’ve used during the current and past billing cycles.
How can I manage my spending on the API platform?
You can set a monthly budget in
your billing settings⁠
⁠
(opens in a new window)
, after which we’ll stop serving your requests. There may be a delay in enforcing the limit, and you are responsible for any overage incurred. You can also configure an email notification threshold to receive an email alert once you cross that threshold each month. We recommend checking your
usage tracking dashboard
⁠
(opens in a new window)
regularly to monitor your spend.
For customers managing work with Projects, you can
set and manage billing restrictions per project
⁠
(opens in a new window)
⁠ in the Dashboard.
Is access to the API included in ChatGPT Plus, Business, Enterprise or Edu?
No, OpenAI APIs are billed separately from ChatGPT Plus,
Business
, Enterprise and Edu. ChatGPT subscription pricing can be found at
openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/
⁠
.
How is pricing calculated for images?
Images are converted into tokens and charged per token. Text models price image tokens at standard text token rates, while GPT Image and gpt-realtime uses a separate image token rate. Models like gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, and o4-mini convert images into tokens differently.
